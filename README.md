# Novel Scraping Script

This script is designed to scrape chapters from a novel website and save them locally.

## Description

This Python script utilizes Selenium with undetected_chromedriver to scrape chapters from the novel "Konoha Deliberately Lost to Hinata at the Start". It iterates through a list of chapter URLs, extracts the content, and saves each chapter as a text file in a local directory named `chapters`. If any errors occur during scraping, they are logged in `error.txt`.
